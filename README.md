## 🌟 **Why HydroSafe Monitor?**  

✅ **Public Health Impact** – Ensures access to clean water, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases.  
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** – Traditional methods are slow; our AI model instantly detects contaminants.  
✅ **Scalability** – Can be implemented across various water sources and regions.  
✅ **Prevention First** – Early alerts allow timely intervention before contamination spreads.

## 📊 **How It Works**  

1️⃣ **Data Collection:**  
- Sensor data from various sources (rivers, lakes, water treatment plants).  
- Parameters: **pH level, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and contaminant levels**.  

2️⃣ **Data Preprocessing:**  
- Handling missing values.  
- Normalization and feature engineering for better accuracy.  

3️⃣ **Model Training (XGBoost Algorithm):**  
- Trained on the **Kaggle Water Quality Dataset**.  
- Achieved an initial accuracy of **67%** (to be improved with more data & tuning).  

4️⃣ **Real-Time Deployment:**  
- Model deployed on **IBM Cloud**.  
- Web-based dashboard for monitoring & alerts.  

5️⃣ **Alert System:**  
- If water quality **falls below safety standards**, an **instant alert** is sent to authorities.
